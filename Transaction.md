# Gunero Transaction Structure

## Definitions

### Account Address and Key
"Account Address" or account refers to the 160-bit identifier used to uniquely identify an
Ethereum given a EDCSA public-private key pair. It is the first 20-bytes of the keccak256
hash of the public key.

Represented as: `A_account` (account public address) and `s_account` (account private key),
where `account` is one of sender (`S`), receiver (`R`), or previous sender (`PS`)

### Authorization Root Hash
The "Authorization Root Hash" is the root hash of the sparse merkle tree data structure used to track
the authorization status of accounts in the system. The key used for obtaining this root hash is the
Ethereum account address `A_account`, and the status is at the leaf.

Represented as: `W` (`W_P` used for "previous auth root hash")

### Account View Hash and Randomizer
In order to tie the authorization proof (which is generated once per Plasma cycle),
to the specific transaction in which a token is spent without incurring prohibitive
overhead on the transaction process, we need to define a public parameter that is shared
between the proofs verifying that the Account used to generate the authorization
proof is the same account specified in the given transaction. The "view hash" is this
data structure, protected from pre-imaging attacks from the use of a randomized secret
called the "randomizer" that is never publicly divulged. The view hash is re-computed every cycle,
but can be safely used multiple times within a given cycle to participate in different trades.

Represented as: `V_account` (view hash) and `r_account` (randomizer)

The view hash is computed as follows:
```
V_account = hash(A_account + W + r_account)
```

### Token Unique Identifier
In order to obfuscate the serial numbers being traded on GunClear's network from surveilance, we hide
the serial number with a unique and uncorrelated identifier called a "Token UID". This identifier is
generated by the first account that originally "tokenized" the firearm, and is constructed from the
serial number of the firearm, and a "Firearm View Randomizer" which is a randomly generated number.
This number is shared between all owners of the firearm and can be used to verify, prior to trading,
that an owner actually "owns" that firearm, similar to 2FA (something you have and something you know).

Represented as: `T` (Token UID) and `j` (Firearm View Randomizer)

The Token UID is computed as follows:
```
T = hash(F + j)
```
where `F` is the firearm's serial number, in a standardized numerical format (which may be pre-processed)

### Transaction Hash
The transaction hash is what the Gunero operators use to track the current state of ownership of a given firearm token.
It is used as a commitment/nullifier in a similar fashion to Zcash; however, since we do not have a need to perform
join-split transactions, we were able to reduce it to a single spending commitment based on the owner's private key.

Represented as: `txn` (`txn_P` is used for previous)

This hash is computed as follows:
```
txn = hash(A_S + s_R + T + W)
```
