# Gunero Transaction Structure

## Definitions

### Account View Hash
In order to tie the authorization proof (which is generated once per Plasma cycle),
to the specific transaction in which a token is spent without incurring prohibitive
overhead on the transaction process, there is a need to define a public parameter that
is shared between the proofs verifying that the Account used to generate the authorization
proof is the same account specified in the transaction. It is re-computed every cycle,
but can be used multiple times within a given cycle.

This hash is computed as follows:
```
hash(account + current authorization root hash + account view randomizer)
```
The "account view randomizer" is a randomly generated number, uncorrelated with the account.

### Token Unique Identifier
"Firearm View Randomizer" (random j) - randomly generated number shared between all owners of the firearm.
This is used to "encrypt" the firearm's serial number to only those who are given access to the connection
between the two, including GunClear (who mints the token).
This can also be used to prove ownership of a firearm, similar to 2FA (something you have and something you know).

This hash is computed as follows:
```
hash(serial number + firearm view randomizer)
```
The "firearm view randomizer" is generated by the originating owner, and must be passed between each participant
in the chain of ownership.

### Transaction Hash
The transaction hash is what the Gunero operators use to track the current state of ownerships of a given token.
It is used as a commitment/nullifier in a similar fashion to Zcash; however, since we do not have a need to perform
join-split transactions, we were able to reduce it to a single spending commitment based on the owner's private key.

This hash is computed as follows:
```
hash(sender's account address, receiver's private key, token UID, authorization root)
```

## Transaction Setup
In setting up a transaction, the sender must share the following with the receiver:

The sender should share the following with the receiver (not strictly required):
* Sender Account Status (uint2 plain)
* Sender Authorization Proof

The receiver must share the following with the sender:
* Receiver Account Address (bytes20 hash)
* Receiver Account View Hash (bytes32 hash)
* Receiver Account View Randomizer (uint128 plain)
* Receiver Authorization Proof
